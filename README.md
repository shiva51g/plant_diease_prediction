# GreenScan ðŸŒ¿ â€“ Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

An AI-powered image classification system that detects plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, trained on 54,000+ images from Kaggle, and achieves 96% accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Classifies healthy and diseased leaves across 38 plant disease categories
- 96% accuracy on validation data
- Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- Simple web interface built with Streamlit for real-time predictions

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source**: [New Plant Diseases Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
- ~54,000 labeled images across 38 classes
